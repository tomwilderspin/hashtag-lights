HashTag Lights !!

Xmas lights which track tweets from a hashtag
----

Designed for the Raspberry pi, this app pulls down live tweets for a hashtag
and controls addressable RGB LED lights listening on the GPIO pins.

Tweet delivery velocity dictates speed of led changes, tweet content changes led colour.

Thanks to the great tutorial by Seb which helped with the hardware side of the project: stranger-things <https://24ways.org/2016/internet-of-stranger-things/>
